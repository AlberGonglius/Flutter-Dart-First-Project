# Flutter-Dart-First-Project
My First Project in Dart using Flutter framework


Hospital App, it allows to register patients, Doctor and Dates, also modify them and delete them. Has some curious features as camera and gallery for adding photos, whatsapp url_launcer, Login for Doctors and admin, and connection to firebase Database. The connection to Firebase Database uses lists of Dart maps which are very similar to Python Dictionaries.
